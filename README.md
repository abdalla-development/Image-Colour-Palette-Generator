# Image-Colour-Palette-Generator
Portfolio
    • This project was really tricky, at first you must read the image, get the RGB values of each pixel in the image, convert the RGB values into a Hex code, after that you would need to count the colour occurrence in the image and arrange the in a descending format.
    • The hard part was to get the RGB values as you need to read each pixel individually and you would need to find the mechanism for that.
    • There was no easy part and as you know what to do it will take an effort to find or create a function that would work and perform as you need.
    • The biggest lean from to day was to explore various python and modules   is necessary you don’t need to know them all, but at least to know various modules basic functionality as many as you can. 
    • For improvement a display of the top 10 colours values real colour might be good.
